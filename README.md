# ERC20 Minted CannabisToken 

## Description
Source code found [here](https://github.com/DApperNetwork1/Ethereum-Developer-Bootcamp)

GOAL: Create your own functional Minted Crowdsale Ethereum smart contract, deploy it onto the Rinkeby test network, and publish your contract address so that your classmates may purchase your custom token.

It’s recommended that you compile and deploy your smart contracts using the Remix browser. You’ll want to use “Javascript VM” while you’re testing the functionality of your smart contracts before you actually deploy them onto the Rinkeby test network so that you don’t have to use up test ether and wait for each transaction to be confirmed.
